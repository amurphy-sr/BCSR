They make a deliberate break from the standard academic track to dive straight into college at an age when most of their peers are just heading into their junior or senior years of high school.</p>           <p>And Simon’s Rock is not a halfway college or an unconventional prep school. It’s a rigorous four-year institution, accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC), part of the prestigious Bard network, and regularly recognized for its excellence (ranked #7 in the Princeton Review’s top 20 schools with the most highly rated faculty; students awarded 9 Fullbright fellowships since 2010).</p>           <p>We know this path is not for everyone, but for those who make the leap, choosing early college at Simon’s Rock has been demonstrated over 50 years to give our students a head start on finding and pursuing their passions — and to set them up for a lifetime of personal and professional success.</p>                              <h3>Early College Ready</h3>          <p>The time to undertake a challenging interdisciplinary college program is the moment a young person is most curious about the world, most driven to ask big questions, and flexible enough in their thinking to make profound connections. For many bright students, that time comes well before a conventional high school track allows.</p>           <p>At Simon’s Rock, our students thrive because they are given the chance to do challenging work in an engaged community at the moment they are ready for it.</p>                    <div class="text-center">            <p>The admission process is just that - a process.

By “early college” some people may mean AP classes or IB programs, or dual enrollment at a high school and college. It is also sometimes used to describe a situation in which a student graduates early and enrolls in college classes with an older cohort.</p>            <p>Early college at Simon’s Rock is different. We’re the only full-time, four year, highly ranked college of the liberal arts and sciences designed for motivated students ready for college after the 10th or 11th grade.</p>             <p>If it’s the right decision for you, you’ll leave high school (a diploma isn’t required) and start college.</p>            <blockquote>              <p class="blockquote-last">I think it’s a really bold move to do something different. It’s a big leap to make, but once you’re here, there’s so much support that it feels like an easy transition.</p>              <cite>-Amanda Johnston</cite>            </blockquote>            <h3>The full college experience.</h3>            <p>Simon’s Rock is a small, intensive college of the liberal arts and sciences specifically designed to offer students a broad-minded, paradigm-shifting college education after the 10th or 11th grade. We take young minds seriously enough to offer a full college experience beyond what they might get from an AP/IB class or a test that duplicates college textbook material.</p>            <div class="text-center page--link">              <a class="right-arrow-primary" href="#"><i class="fa fa-angle-right bold"></i> See for yourself what the academic experience at Simon’s Rock looks like. </a>            </div>            <h3>A community of peers.</h3>            <p>Our <a href="students">students</a> join a diverse, tight-knit community of their intellectual and chronological peers. We’re a community of individuals, but nobody is an outlier here because of their age, or their decision to seek greater academic challenges.</p>            <h3>It’s not about grades.</h3>            <p>While many Rockers were academic stars in high school, some were students who failed to prosper under the limits and constraints of the typical high school experience—students who did not flourish academically until they got to Simon’s Rock. We examine each applicant holistically when evaluating college-readiness, looking for students who aren’t motivated by grades or acing the test, but who are instead motivated by ideas, by the prospect of knowing more, making connections, surprising themselves, and applying their brains to thorny problems and complicated issues.</p>            <h3>Support where it counts.</h3>            <p>Our students benefit from the guidance of talented and dedicated <a href="faculty">faculty</a> and the support of experienced <a href="safety">Student Life</a> staff. It’s a support system thoughtfully conceived to help younger college students find their footing and make their way into adulthood. </p>            <h3>One decision, unlimited possibilities.</h3>            <p>Rockers know that once you have your BA or AA without finishing high school, you’ve received all the credentials you’ll need to meet your educational and professional goals. Grad schools and employers may want to know your story, but they’re most interested in how well prepared you are for the challenges ahead, not whether you have a high school diploma.  Starting college early at Simon’s Rock gives our students many more options for completing their <a href="degree-options">studies</a> and pursuing <a href="reputation">their goals</a>. They’re ready, earlier, and have the degrees to prove it.            <blockquote>              <p class="blockquote-last">We really take the word education seriously, because education, if you break that word down, it means to draw forth. I don’t think we cram in, we draw forth. Even though we are giving them a lot of sophisticated information that really is college level, and we treat them like college students because people will respond as you treat them.</p>              <cite>Karen Beaumont, Division Head in the Arts</cite>            </blockquote>            <h3>Fifty years of Early College innovation.</h3>            <p>Fifty years ago, Simon’s Rock was founded as the nation’s <a href="movement">first early college</a>, and we’ve been an innovative leader ever since. We are a proud member of the <a href="network">Bard network</a>, and have helped shape a vision for early college that sets the highest standards for excellence and exceeds expectations for student support.</p>             <blockquote>              <p class="blockquote-last">We delay a serious engagement with intellectual material - science, art, literature, history - too long. And, so when they arrive at college at eighteen, in my view, we have lost some of the best years of the life of a young person who wants to learn.</p>              <cite>Leon Botstein, President of Bard College and Bard College at Simon’s Rock</cite>            </blockquote>    </div></div>        <!-- /CENTER COLUMN -->        <!-- RIGHT COLUMN -->        <div class="column-right">          <!-- Right Callout -->                    <!-- /Right Callout -->        </div>        <!-- RIGHT COLUMN -->      </div>      <!-- << /Section One >> -->      <!-- << Section Two >> -->      <div class="row-full-width">        <!-- LEFT COLUMN -->        <div class="column-left">                  </div>        <!-- /LEFT COLUMN-->        <!-- CENTER COLUMN -->                                                    </div>          <!-- /Steps to Getting Aid -->                                                                          </div>        <!-- RIGHT COLUMN-->        <div class="column-right">        </div>          <!-- /RIGHT COLUMN -->      </div>      <!-- << /Section Two >> -->    </div><!-- /container-fluid -->    <div class="row-full-width">      <!-- Sidbar Mobile Nav -->      <div class="side-nav-mobile">        <!-- Subnav -->        <ul class="flat-list list-group list-group-mobile">          <li><div class="list-group-item active section-header">Tuition and Financial Aid</div></li>            <li><a href="#" class="list-group-item">Tuition and Fees</a></li>            <li><a href="#" class="list-group-item active">Financial Aid and Scholarships</a>            	<ul class="flat-list list-group">            		<li><a href="#" class="list-group-item">Sub item</a></li>            		<li><a href="#" class="list-group-item">Sub item nav link that runs long</a></li>            		<li><a href="#" class="list-group-item">Sub item</a></li>            	</ul>            </li>            <li><a href="#" class="list-group-item">Dates and Deadlines</a></li>            <li><a href="#" class="list-group-item">Checklists and Application Tips</a></li>        </ul>        <!-- /Subnav -->      </div>      <!-- /Sidbar Mobile Nav-->    </div><?php include '_inc/footer.php'; ?>    <?php include '_inc/bottom-js.php' ?>  <script type="text/javascript" src="/_js/greensock/TweenMax.min.js"></script>  <script type="text/javascript" src="/_js/scrollmagic/jquery.scrollmagic.js"></script>  <script type="text/javascript" src="/_js/scrollmagic/jquery.scrollmagic.debug.js"></script>  <script>    var controller;    var scene_callout;    $(document).ready(function($) {          // init controller      controller = new ScrollMagic();      // Callout parallax      callout_parallax();      $(window).on('debouncedresize', function( event ) {        callout_parallax();      });    });function callout_parallax(){  if ($(window).width() >= 1370){    var tween_callout = TweenMax.fromTo('.callout-box', 1.5,         { 'margin' : '20px 0;'},        { 'margin' : '-500px 0'}      );    // build scene    scene_callout = new ScrollScene({duration: 700}).setTween(tween_callout).addTo(controller);  }  else{    $('.callout-box').css("margin","20px 0");    controller.removeScene(scene_callout);    console.log(scene_callout);  }}  </script>      </body></html>
